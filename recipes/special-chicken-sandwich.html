      <li>A rainbow brioche bun (found only in the land of Bornwood)</li>
      <li>Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>Fresh tomato</li>
      <li>Chicken breast</li>
      <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>Renowned Bornwood eggwash</li>
      <li>Fresh lettuce leaves blessed with the spirit of Bornwood</li>
      <li>Pickled gherkins (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place your bun on your workstation, slicing it into two halves. Butter
        'em. Toast em. Spread each with mayonnaise afterwards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take your chicken breast fillet and dunk it in a good Bornwood eggwash.
        Soak thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once soaked, coat well in breadcrumbs. Toss it in the deep (or air)
        fryer afterwards.
      </li>
      <li>Once done, place on one bun half.</li>
      <li>
        Take great care in placing the Bornwood-spirit imbued lettuce leaf on
        top and take in all of its glory while doing so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare and place all other ingredients on top to your liking with the
        other bun at the very last.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
